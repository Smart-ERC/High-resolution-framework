# High-resolution-framework

We are developing a structurally constrained unsupervised deep learning framework designed to enhance the resolution of post-stack seismic data.

This approach leverages geological structural constraints to guide the learning process, enabling the network to preserve stratigraphic continuity and structural integrity while improving seismic resolution.
